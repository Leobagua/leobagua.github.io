# Uderstanding Design Patterns

## Introduction

Design patterns are largely used by the software community and companies.
These proven solutions help developers to better solve commonly known problems in a quickly and effective way.
Knowing about design patterns is a required skill that every software engineer must to have.
They will help you to dive deep into more complex software applications and will improve your ability to communicate with other engineers through the use of a well known design pattern language.

In this post, I'll introduce you to several design principles that will help you to write more **flexible**, **reusable** and **maintainable** applications. Through these principles, you will be able to identify bad software design and code smells.  

## What is a Design Pattern

Being a software engineer implies that you will often come across with the same design problem many times.
Although there is many ways to deal with these problems, often time some solutions will be preferred over others, by the simple fact that they're more flexible and reusable. 

A design pattern is a practical proven solution to a recurring design problem.
Design patterns allow developers, engineers and software architects to use previously 
outlined solutions by experts and that companies have often used to solve a software problems.


_Software development is an art. You must to put beauty in your software through the use of clean code and clean architecture. This is the true way to reach maintainability, scalability and a very happy team._
